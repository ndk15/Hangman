### ICS3UC - S1 2023-24, Mr. Brash
## RST - Final Project

It's time! You are going to build a web-application _from scratch_. This project is **due at 8:30am on Tuesday, January 23rd** - 20 classes @ 75 mins = 25 hrs of class time. One full month. **That date and time _will not be adjusted_.**

### _Suggested_ Timeline (See descriptions below the table)

| Decide on Game & Start Draft | Draft GUI | PseudoCode (structure) | Code | Test & Fix | Submit _by_|
|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
|By Wed. Dec. 13th| By Dec. 16th|Dec. 18-19|Dec 20th - Jan 17th|Jan 18-22nd|Jan 23rd @ 8:30am|

### Step 1: Proposal
[Click here to complete your proposal](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeLipOD1vG9q36Sgezdo_NnWaL7N62qcPjql6wWCZQ-CDn2Lw/viewform?usp=sf_link). Submit the form with the requested details, to the best of your ability.

### Step 2: Draft GUI (storyboard)
Either on paper, a whiteboard, or a digital image (see the `Draft GUI.draw` file) create and submit a _detailed_ design for the front-end of the program. This should include any and all input from the user as well as extra pages or information panels. Being detailed here will save you time in the future.

### Step 3:  Structure & Pseudocode
Now that you have a front-end, you can begin designing the data structure and functional structure for your program.
- What sort of data structure will you need
  - Do you need an array? Multiple arrays? Strings?
  - Are any of them going to be _global_ variables so that all functions have access to them?
- What HTML elements will you be using?
  - What event-listeners do you need?
  - What will those listeners be calling?
- What is the functional structure of the program?
  - What functions will you need and what will they be called?

### Step 4: Coding
If you planned the GUI and the code structure properly, the coding should be easier at this point.
**Comment your code as you go and adjust the comments as necessary!**
1. Create the basic GUI. Don't worry about colours, fonts, design - don't even worry about specific photos (you can replace them later). Give your elements meaningful IDs and structure the layout to mimic your draft GUI.
2. Connect your JavaScript to the HTML.
    - Create your event listeners and test them - do they act as planned and give the information you need?
    - Create your data structure, global variables, and constants that you decided upon in **Step 3**.

3. Write the functions one-by-one, testing as necessary. Keep notes on changes you foresee or extra functions and algorithms you did not realize you would need during your planning stages. (Do _not_ change your draft or pseudocode, it's ok if they don't match.)

### Step 5: Testing
Test your program _extensively_. Have _someone else_ test your program extensively. Make the appropriate bug fixes or changes to your program. Listen to your tester(s) and consider their input. The user should not need you to explain _anything_ to be able to use your program.

Then test it again. And again...

### Submit!

---

### Important note
The loading of your `script.js` has been placed inside the `<head></head>` portion of your HTML file with the `defer` keyword.
```HTML
<script src="script.js" defer></script>
```
This will load it **last** automatically. Don't move it unless you know you need to.

### Game Selection

Creating a _game_ is more fun than a generic application. That being said if you would rather create a website that has a particular purpose, or something not on this list, pass it by your teacher for approval. Some suggestions include:

| Game / App | Difficulty (subjective opinion) |
|------------|:----------:|
|2 Player Hangman - P1 enters the hidden text<br>[Example](https://hangman-example.mrbrash.repl.co/) | Low to Medium |
|Hangman vs Computer - Hidden text is selected from a list<br>[Text-based example](https://replit.com/@MrBrash/Hangman-v2-Example)| Medium |
|Wordle Remake (perhaps add your own twist) | Medium-High |
|[Encryption / Decryption App](https://simple-encryption-example.mrbrash.repl.co/) | Low |
|[Word Scrambles](https://i0.wp.com/www.happinessishomemade.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Printable-Easter-Word-Scramble.jpg)| Low |
|Lights Out| Medium-High (needs 2D Arrays) |
|Reaction Timer | Low-Medium (timing)<br>Does not cover the course |
|Advanced Cookie Clicker| Medium |
|Mastermind (CodeBreaker) | Medium-High |
|[2048](https://ics3uc-final-project.ninjapenguin21.repl.co/)|Hard (2D Arrays & Much More)|
|Tic-Tac-Toe| Low (`not permitted`)  |
|Tic-Tac-Toe PRO | Med-Hard (2D arrays) |
|Connect 4| Medium |
|Simon| Medium-High<br>(Graphics & Timing) |
|Games of Chance (Roulette, etc) | Medium |
|[Skunk](https://skunk.brash.ca/) | Medium<br>Ask Mr. Brash |
|Math Quizzes | Low-Medium |
|Battleship vs Computer (or similar)| Hard (2D Arrays)|
|[Sliding Puzzle](https://slidingtiles.com/en/puzzle/play/movies/14563-survivor-cagayan)| Medium (2D Arrays)|
|Snakes & Ladders| Medium-High<br>(Graphics & 2D Arrays)|
|Checkers| Medium-High<br>(Graphics & 2D Arrays)|
|Blackjack| Medium (Graphics)<br>Does not cover the course |

* The list above is _not_ exhaustive. See your teacher _immediately_ if you have an idea. It _must_ get approved by your teacher because sometimes ideas seem easy but are very difficult to code (like Battleship, for instance).

### Really important - this cannot be stressed this enough...
If _you_ can find it online, _so can your teacher_. [Plagiarism and academic fraud](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mn7qlQJI1TcwDyh-XPZsjB9Q09BLcz8iuGw3fZkGLeA/edit) are _**very**_ easy to spot. Do everyone a favour and code this project yourself. Yes, you may find inspiration and how to do specific tasks like looping through an array or hiding HTML elements on a page, but following a full tutorial or submitting someone else's work as your own will result in an immediate mark of zero (0). **Period**.

**AI** - I can't believe I have to say this but _any_ use of AI or code-generators, or low-code/no-code tools or ANYTHING that provides code for you or solves your problem for you will result in a mark of zero (0). **Period**.

`If you are feeling lost or stressed and would rather resort to cheating or using AI, come and see me - I will help you!`

### Submitting
As per usual, everything will be housed _in this Repl_. It is expected that you will **submit** the project by the listed due date & time. **If you need extra time, you _must_ contact your teacher _at least_ 72 hours in advance.**

### Final Marks
Overall marks will be determined based on term work, including the Independent Study Unit 0, in-class assignments, completion and participation in Units 1 to 4, a conference with your teacher, _and_ this final project.

### Rubric {suggestions?}

| Look-Fors | Description / Requirements |
|:------------|----------|
|**Computer generated / randomization**|The point in any game is replayability. Your program should not be hard-coded with specific step-by-step answers or easily repeated solutions. The user should experience a different challenge or game every time it is played. Whether this is due to a second human player or a randomized computer player - the game should have replayability built-in.|
|**Comments in the code.** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|Informational comments for complicated or large sections of code are provided to explain/describe the code. Explanations should **_not_** be for each line or variable, but rather larger sections like functions, complicated loops, etc. |
|**Code Style**|Code must be properly spaced/tabbed and easy to read.|
|**Proper variable & function names**|Code should be human-readable. Using proper, descriptive variable or function names is a **must**. For example, if the value is storing some hidden text, the variable `secretText` is much more descriptive than `st`. Function names should almost describe exactly what it does. |
|**Instructions for the user (how to play)**| Do not assume that your user knows how to play the game! Just because _you've_ played Hangman before, does not mean that the person on your site has. Provide a method of learning the rules of the game. Decsription of the rules **must** be clear. |
|**Game / site must be functional**| The submitted game/site needs to be functional. **A submission that throws errors on the console and doesn't play, has buttons that do nothing, or the basic requirements of the game are not implemented is considered _incomplete_.**
|**Usage must be obvious or properly described**| What does this button do? How do I quit? Wait, I have to type it in and then right-click that small picture? That's weird...<br>Your game or site must have a user-friendly layout that provides a clear set of usability. Note that this is different from _instructions_ or being _functional_, as described above. |

### Using Mr. Brash's Hangman Database
If you plan on doing Hangman and you would like to use an already created list of movies or team names, here is how you could do that:

In your **HTML** file, place the following inside the `<head>` section:
```HTML
<script src="https://misterbrash.github.io/Hangman_DB/hangman_helper.js" defer></script>
```

Now to get a secret title, in your JavaScript code you would call the function `getTitle()` like this:
```JS
let title = getTitle(0);
```
The parameter is the type of title (category):

0. [Movie](https://misterbrash.github.io/Hangman_DB/Lists/AA_Movies.txt)
1. [Disney Movie](https://misterbrash.github.io/Hangman_DB/Lists/Disney_Movies.txt)
2. [MLB Team](https://misterbrash.github.io/Hangman_DB/Lists/MLB_Teams.txt)
3. [NHL Team](https://misterbrash.github.io/Hangman_DB/Lists/NHL_Teams.txt)
4. [NBA Team](https://misterbrash.github.io/Hangman_DB/Lists/NBA_Teams.txt)
5. [NFL Team](https://misterbrash.github.io/Hangman_DB/Lists/NFL_Teams.txt)
6. [5 Letter Words](https://misterbrash.github.io/Hangman_DB/Lists/5_Letter_Words.txt)
7. [Beautiful Words](https://misterbrash.github.io/Hangman_DB/Lists/Beautiful_Words.txt)
8. [NBA Players](https://misterbrash.github.io/Hangman_DB/Lists/NBA_Players.txt)
9. [Spanish 5-Letter Words](https://misterbrash.github.io/Hangman_DB/Lists/Spanish.txt)

If you would like a new category or entry added, contact Mr. Brash.
