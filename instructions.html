  HangMan is a very simple game that all ages can play. In the version that I have created, the computer will choose a word related to the topic provided. The player (aka you) will try and figure out the unknown word by guessing letters. If too many letters which do not appear in the word are guessed, the player is hanged (and loses). If you still don't understand the game, click the image below to watch a video explaining the game. <br> <br>
